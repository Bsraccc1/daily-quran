# Daily Quran

Modern Android Quran reader built with Jetpack Compose and Material 3. Bundles all 604 Mushaf Madinah pages, an offline ayah-coordinate database for tap-to-highlight, and streams recitations on demand.

To Do :
- Add translations for each verse
- Display only the translation of the currently highlighted verse; for the translation download interface, activate it when the translation button is clicked, and display a complete list of available translations from the API, such as from quran.com and others
- The translation interface should not cover the entire screen, but rather appear as a vertical slider
- Add an option to display only the highlighted verse, or all verses
- Translate on every page; if a page starts at 1 and ends at 7, display only 1–7 if the user selects all verses,
- if the user selects verse 6, display only the translation of verse 6
- Add more reciters to the audio
- New Quran layout type
- Ensure all user interfaces function across all phone screen resolutions (DPI)
- Add home page session management, which can be based on a specific juz or page
- Add landscape mode support; when the phone is in landscape mode, the Quran reader will be zoomed in for easier reading
- Replace all Mac blur effects in the source code with Gaussian Blur for better aesthetics
- Users can switch surahs via the swipe-down interface in the Quran reader
- Add landscape and portrait orientation toggle buttons in the swipe-up interface in the Quran reader
- Add distinct button interfaces in the swipe-down interface for navigation option 1 (surah and verse) and option 2 (page)
- Updated the screenshot preview in readme.md

Known bugs:
- Audio download interface: after clicking “Browse Surah,” users cannot click “Settings” again
- Session progress updates only occur when clicking “Continue Reading,” not when actually switching to the next page to update progress in session management
  (consider adding a delay of about 5 seconds to ensure the user has scrolled and is reading on the new page)
- User interface (UI) positioning is not optimal on other devices such as phones, etc.
- UI positioning is poor on other devices, such as phones.


## Old Screenshots (not updated screenshot)

### Mushaf Reader

| Page 1 — Al-Fatihah (light) | Page 2 — Al-Baqarah (light) | Page 1 — Dark mode |

The Mushaf renderer uses bundled transparent-background WebP images tinted at runtime, so the calligraphy follows the active theme without any "white card" flashing in dark mode.

### Reader info panel

Single-tap a page to reveal the floating control bar — back, translation, memorize, page number, audio playback, and bookmark.

## Features

- **Offline Mushaf reader** — 604 Madinah pages bundled as transparent WebP, ~53 MB, tinted with the active Material 3 colour scheme.
- **Tap-to-highlight ayah** — long-press anywhere on a page to highlight the matching ayah using the bundled `ayahinfo.db` glyph rectangles.
- **Reading sessions** — set a page target, track progress, finish or extend; the dashboard surfaces the active session and overall progress (page X of 604).
- **Bookmarks** — page-level bookmarks with optional notes; one-tap toggle from the reader info panel.
- **Three navigation tabs** — Juz (30), Surah (114) with Makki/Madani classification, and Hizb (60).
- **Translation overlay** — Sahih International (English) and Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs (Bahasa Indonesia), downloaded once and cached in Room.
- **Streaming recitation** — Media3 ExoPlayer with on-disk cache (`SimpleCache` + `CacheDataSource`), per-surah download manager, ayah-level highlight sync from the quran.com timing API.
- **Memorization (Hifz) mode** — overlay with repeat targets (3 / 5 / 10 / 20), persisted history, looping playback through the dedicated ExoPlayer.
- **Five themes** — Zamrud Islami, Teal & Dusk, Amber Masjid, Indigo Malam, and Material You (Android 12+), each with light and dark variants.
- **Bilingual UI** — English and Bahasa Indonesia, switchable from Settings without an app restart on most screens.
- **Home-screen widget** — `QuranWidgetProvider` shows reading progress at a glance.

## Build

Requirements: Android SDK 34, JDK 17, Gradle wrapper bundled.

```bash
# Debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Release APK (R8 enabled)
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Install on connected device / emulator
./gradlew installDebug
```

Common dev commands:

```bash
./gradlew clean                  # remove build outputs
./gradlew :app:lint              # Android lint
./gradlew test                   # JVM unit tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest   # instrumented tests on a device
```

The mushaf page assets and `ayahinfo.db` are committed to the repo, so a fresh clone builds and runs without any extra download step.

## How it works

### Mushaf rendering

`MushafImageRenderer` lays out a `BoxWithConstraints` whose aspect ratio matches the source image (1024×1656). The page is loaded with Coil's `AsyncImage`, drawn with `ContentScale.FillBounds`, and tinted via `ColorFilter.tint(theme.text, BlendMode.SrcIn)`. Because the image is alpha-only (transparent background, ink in the alpha channel), `SrcIn` paints the calligraphy in the theme's text colour over a `theme.background`-coloured `Box`.

`MushafImagePageViewModel` queries the bundled `ayahinfo.db` (Room's `createFromAsset`) for the page's `GlyphEntity` rows. On long press, `hitTest` divides the touch offset by the runtime scale factors and returns the first glyph whose pixel rectangle contains the point — that surfaces the ayah's `(surah, ayah)` to the parent screen, which then shows the translation sheet or audio popup.

When audio is playing, the highlight switches to an audio-driven `HighlightedAyah` (computed from `currentAudioAyah`), so the highlighted line follows the recitation rather than the last tap.

### Reading sessions

`ReadingViewModel` owns a single `SessionState` machine — `IDLE`, `INPUT_PENDING`, `ACTIVE`, `COMPLETE` — persisted in DataStore so the dashboard can resume the active session across launches. The Mushaf reader observes session state to auto-show the "Session complete" sheet when `pagesReadInSession >= sessionTargetPages`.

### Audio

`AudioService` is a Media3 `MediaSessionService` that builds an `ExoPlayer` whose `MediaSourceFactory` is wrapped by `AudioCacheManager` (a `CacheDataSource.Factory` over a `SimpleCache` rooted at `cacheDir/audio`). Surah downloads pre-warm the same cache through `AudioDownloadWorker`, so an offline-cached surah plays back immediately with no network hit.

`HighlightSyncEngine` polls the player's position and emits the active `AyahKey` based on `AyahTimingRepository` rows fetched from the quran.com timing API and persisted in Room.

## Permissions

Declared in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

- `INTERNET`, `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`, `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` — translation download, audio streaming, timing API
- `WAKE_LOCK`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` — Media3 audio service
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC` — WorkManager surah downloads
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` — playback + download progress (Android 13+)
- `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` — playing locally cached recitations on Android 13+
- `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS`, `VIBRATE`, `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` — playback polish

The app does not request location, contacts, camera, or any analytics SDK permissions.
